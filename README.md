TaskPlanner

TaskPlanner is a java-based compute task to heterogeneous resource execution planner.

# Overview
To ensure that the best planner algorithm can be developed, the input (tasks and resources) and output (task execution plan) are defined in data model objects. This way any and all algorithms and their variants and experimentation can be tested for speed and accuracy in the same way.
